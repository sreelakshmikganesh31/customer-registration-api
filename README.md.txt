# Customer Registration API

This project is a Django REST Framework (DRF) CRUD API for managing customer data with Swagger & Redoc API documentation.

## Features
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) customers
- Swagger UI for API testing
- SQLite database for easy setup

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sreelakshmikganesh31/customer-registration-api.git


For easier testing, I have removed my virtual environment and __pycache__ folders from the project.
I also temporarily switched the database configuration from MySQL to SQLite so the project can run immediately without additional setup.
